# Python Does Countdown

Quoth [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_%28game_show%29):

> Countdown is a British game show involving word and number puzzles.
>
> The two contestants in each episode compete in three disciplines: eleven
> letters rounds, in which the contestants attempt to make the longest word
> possible from nine randomly chosen letters; three numbers rounds, in which
> the contestants must use arithmetic to reach a random target number from
> six other numbers; and the conundrum, a buzzer round in which the
> contestants compete to solve a nine-letter anagram.

I was watching the show and decided that it'd be easy for a computer to win it.

## Installing and Running

This Python module is nothing particularly fancy.  Running the module will just kick off a simulation of a game of *Countdown* that the computer will play against itself.  On my machine:

```
$ python --version
Python 2.7.3
$ git clone https://github.com/ajvondrak/countdown.git countdown
$ python -m countdown
```
