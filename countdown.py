Python does Countdown.

Quoth https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_%28game_show%29

    Countdown is a British game show involving word and number puzzles.

    The two contestants in each episode compete in three disciplines: eleven
    letters rounds, in which the contestants attempt to make the longest word
    possible from nine randomly chosen letters; three numbers rounds, in which
    the contestants must use arithmetic to reach a random target number from
    six other numbers; and the conundrum, a buzzer round in which the
    contestants compete to solve a nine-letter anagram.

I was watching the show and decided that it'd be easy for a computer to win it.
